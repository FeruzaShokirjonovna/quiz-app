## Design Choices

### Fonts
I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've opted for 'Roboto'.
### Icons
As for icons I decided to use for my website [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").
 
### Colors
- #e5dbff- violet : for background of Home page;
- #fff - white: for name input, Rules background, Result text;
- #e7f5ff - blue: for Quiz background;
- red and green : for showing correct and wrong answer options, also for score indicator (#06da8c-green; #f03e3e-red);  
- #19523d: for quiz box border, header and footer borders;
- #cccccc: for background of score indicators;
- #1c7ed6: for next button in quiz;

### Structure
The website will follow a mobile-first strategy, the main target is to create a visually appealing design for smaller screens. As for the smallest design I chose Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone x.
